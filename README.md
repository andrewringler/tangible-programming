# MacroScope

This is the web client served by the ShapeDisplay.
It runs the MacroScope application, which displays a virtual simulation (3js) mirroring the state of the Physical Shape display with additional information.

A websocket enables two-way communication between the physical shape display and the virtual version in the browser.
